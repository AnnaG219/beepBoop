## Beep Boop

#### **Epicodus Arrays & Looping Project** _04.05.2019_

### _By Anna Gibbons_

### **Description**

A webpage that uses array and for loop concepts. With those concepts this program allows a user to input and submit a number of their choice, the output returned will list every number leading up to and equal to the number originally inputted. However the numbers that are listed and returned follow certain specifications; If any number contains a 3 the output will be, "I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I cant do that.", instead of the number containing 3 and if a number contains a 2 it will output "Boop" instead of the number containing a 2, and if a number contains a 1 it will output "Beep" instead of the number containing a 1. So if the User submitted "3" as their number, they would receive back "0, 'Beep', 'Boop', 'I'm sorry Dave, i'm afraid I can't do that.'" as the output.
